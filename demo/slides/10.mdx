# Accessability

A trending theme at CascadiaJS was about Accessability; by making apps faster with service workers to offload heavy processing, or making apps easier for perhaps a patient with some type of disorder that impairs the use of their fingers/eyes/etc. We have an amazing toolbox to help make our apps/etc. easy to use, for everyone.
