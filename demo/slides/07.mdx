# Gatsby Themes

Gatsby is a "framework" for quickly building static sites with React. Gatsby Themes are plugins that include a config file and pre-configured functionality/data sourcing/UI code. This allows you to do some pretty cool things, fairly quickly. For example, the presenter of this talk did a case study with two MLS sites.

* They couldn't change the data source
* They needed the site to be multi-lingual
* They needed the site to look different, depending on the language

They were able to share configuration/parts of design/components by using Gatsby themes; the second site took 30 minutes to create after the first was completed.
