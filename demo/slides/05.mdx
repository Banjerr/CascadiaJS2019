# Building For Budgets

With tools like WebAssemble/AssemblyScript and Web Workers, we can provide a better experience and performance overall for lower powered/connected/end devices/networks. Several talks were by people who are working to offload heavy processing to worker threads, in order for the client to be as quick and lean as possible. 

An engineer from Slack demonstrated how they rebuilt their app, which was using jQuery for parts of the DOM manipulation functionality and an eager data model (had to wait for all the assets to load before the app was ready), to a lazily loaded and incomplete data model, with offloading some processes to service workers for a quicker DOM render. 

**They made extensive use of the profiler in Chrome to set/achieve their metrics.**
