# Machine Learning for front-end devs

There are now JavaScript libraries using TensorFlow and other similar Machine Learning technologies, enabling front end developers to utilize ML. For example, using JavaScript and a camera it would be possible to determine when a vape cart is low and needs to be refilled.

The presenter of this talk gave several examples

* Willy detector - the app was a drawing app where the user could go to a site, draw on a canvas, and the drawing would appear on an LED matrix somewhere in the physical world - she trained a nerual network to recognize pictures of "willies" (NSFA) and reject them - this was a HILARIOUS demo
* Recycle Or not? - this app used the camera, and looked at what a person was holding in the frame to determine if it was recyclable or not - pretty awesome
* Keyboard Teacher - this was pretty cool - a keyboard that uses the camera to track the users eyes, in order to use the keyboard - making it more accessible for a user who cant type, maybe
* Beat Saber - this was a game that used the camera to track her hands/body movements in order to control the game; to bring virtual reality games to those who don't have a VR headset
